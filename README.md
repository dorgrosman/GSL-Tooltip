#### Technologies
Vanilla Javascript

#### Description
The project involves a guided learning frontend engine that acts as a pop-up tooltip on an exisitng website (google.com). 
The guide shows what features can be accessed through Google's homepage. 
By getting information from the provided JSONP, I was able to plan what it would look like and how it would behave by injecting a script into Google's homepage using DevTools Console.


#### Setup Instructions
Go to www.google.com and then open the inspect(ctrl+shipt+i). Then select a source, open a new snippet, and then paste the existing code into the Player.js file.
You can then run the code (ctrl + Enter).
